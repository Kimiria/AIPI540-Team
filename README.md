# Monitoring Mask Compliance in Classrooms

## Introduction

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic changed the way students attend class in a traditional classroom setting. With schools and universities moving back to in-person instruction, wearing masks in the classroom has become critical to preventing the spread of the virus. However, this only works when everyone is adhering to and following mask wearing guidelines. Our computer vision tool monitors mask compliance by students in the classroom, and detects whether or not a student is wearing a mask. It also allows for certain common actions, such as drinking liquids, to be detected and a valid reason to not wear a mask.
